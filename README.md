# Milestone Project 3 - Explore London 
View the live project here 

***
## **What is the purpose of this project?**
Explore London is an app that aims to provide a platform where users are able to discover the best places to stay, eat and
drink as well as the best things to do in the capitol. The app will enable users to register and create their own account where 
they will be able to add their own recommendations to the website as well as edit and delete them if they wish to do so. 

The app is aimed at a wide range of users, from locals who live in the city, to tourists who are visiting London for the first time and want 
plan what they are going to do during their stay in the city. 

The main aim for me was to create an app that had an intuitive user interface and created a sense of community amongst its users. 

This project was my third Milestone Project as part of the Diploma in Software Development at Code Institute.

## **User Experience**

## User Stories 

Before I began the design proccess for my project I created the following user stories. This really helped me understand more 
about the kind of users the website may attract and how I could go about desinging an interface that would satisfy their needs. 

### **Project Stakeholders** 

* Being the creator of the Exlpore London app I am the main project stakeholder so it was in my best interest to provide 
a platform that staisfied all potential users needs through an intuitive user interface that is easy on the eye and simple to navigate 
which in turn should encourage users to return to use the app again. 

### New users 

* I am user who is going to being visiting London for the first time. I want to use an app which will enable me to 
plan my entire trip. I am wanting to find the best place for me stay, places to eat and drink and things to do during my visit.

* I am a user who currently lives central London. Me and my partner have been drinking in the same pub for years and have decided 
we want to start exploring some of the other pubs in London. I want to find an app where I can find recommendations for the best pubs to go to. 

* I am a user who lives in London. I have two children and the summer holidays are approaching so I am wanting to find an app that 
will help me find some new and exciting things for us to do. 

### Returning Users 

* I am a user who has the been using the app over the last few months. I recently ate out at an amazing resteraunt in Shoreditch
so i have returned to add it to the app as a new recommendation. 

* I am a user who visits London every summer. Last year I planned my trip using the app which was fantastic so I have returned 
again this year to plan my upcoming trip. 

* I am a user who regularly travels to London on business. I always use the app to keep up to date with the best places to stay
in London whilst I am on my business trips. 

### Mobile user 

* I am a user who wants to use the app on my mobile device. I want it to be intuitive to use as well as the information being presented 
in a clear and organised fashion. 

## **Design Proccess**

### UX Research 

Before I began the initial design proccess of my project I took some time to research some other websites that are providing a similar 
service to what I want my app to provide. The main things I was looking for was the way in which these platforms presented their information
and how they enabled their users to add their own content. 

The following web pages helped give me inspiration to beign designing my own project.

## **UX Design**

### The Strategy Plane

After spending some time researching similar websites it became apparent to me that there were plenty of recommendation websites 
out there but none really that were specifally for London and that enabled users to add their own content. This made me realise 
that were was an audience of users who's needs were not currently being met. With this in mind it was apparent to me that there
was a gap in the market for this app and that if I carefully design it with these users in mind, the app could potentially be 
a great success.

### The Scope Plane 

With the general idea for the app in place it was time for me to begin planning what features the webstie would have. It 
was clear to me that the app would need to have full CRUD functionality to give the best user experience. This would enable users
to create content, read content, update their own content and also delete content if they wished to do so.

I decided that each user would be directed to their own profile page after logging in where they would be presented with a
welcome message. The app would also have a contact page that would enable users to get in touch with us as well as being able 
to see where our office locations are.

It was also very important to me that the app was as intuitive to use for the user as possible. This was achieved through a fixed 
nav bar that enables the user to navigate to any page on the website at any time. At the bottom of each page there is a back to 
top button which enables the user to return back to the top of the page that they are currently viewing. 

### The Structure Plane 

It was now time for me to begin planning how the features of the app were going to be structured. As the main concept behind
the app is users giving recommendations, I decided that these should be on the main page for the website.
So the home page is where all of the recommendations are displayed. The users would be able to filter these by category or if they want
they will be able to search the recommendations. 

I decided that cetrain pages would only be availble to users who are registered and logged in, but I still wanted users who weren't logged in 
to be able to view the recommendations. 

The users profile would be the place where they are able to view all of their own recommendations as well as being able to edit and delete them. 
On the users profile they would also be presented with the opportunity to add their own recommendation which would direct to the form to do so. 

The Admin for the website would be able to access an additional page which would allow them to add new categories to the app
as well as edit and delete them. 

### The Skeleton Plane 

With the main concept now in place for my app it was now time to start thinking about how the users will use and get around the app 
and ensure that it meets the needs of it's target audience. As mentioned previusly all users whether they are logged in or not would be presented 
with the home page where they will be able to read all of the recommendations. Each recommendation can be clicked on which present the user
with the full details about that paticular recommendation. From here the user can click the Back To Home button to return to the home page.  

If users decide to, they can access the register page from the nav bar to create their own profile. After regsitering the user will be redirected 
to their profile where they will be presented with a welcome message and the opportunity to add their first recommendation. 
To add a recommendation the user will be presented with a form where they can add the category, name, brief description, full details, image and the date, 
then they will be redirected back to their profile where they will be able to see their recommnedation and will be 
edit or delete it if they wish to do so.

On the contact page the user is presented with a form which enables them to present their own credentials and send a message to 
the Explore London team. Below this the user is presented with the an intuitive Google Maps API which allows the users to drop markers onto
the map to see the office locations as well as being presented with the office details. 

### The Surface Plane

I decided to keep the colour scheme for the app as simple as I could to make sure it wasn't to distracting and enabled the users 
to focus more on the actual content of the website. It was now time for me to start designing my wireframes using Figma. This really helped 
me bring my ideas to life and plan exactly what the structure of the website was going to look like. 

I decided that I wanted each page to contain a hero image section as I beleive that these are a very positive thing 
for the user to be presented with when landing on a page, they look professional and give the user a good first impression when 
arriving on a paticular page. 

I used Google fonts to select the fonts for the app and I decided to use the Raleway font and I used Sans Seriff as a back up font should this fail to 
load correctly. 

I used font awesome throughout the website for various icons which are predominantly used on buttons.
