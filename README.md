View the live project here 

***
## **What is the purpose of this project?**
Explore London is an app that aims to provide a platform where users are able to discover the best places to stay, eat and
drink as well as the best things to do in the capitol. The app will enable users to register and create their own account where 
they will be able to add their own recommendations to the website as well as edit and delete them if they wish to do so. 

The app is aimed at a wide range of users, from locals who live in the city, to tourists who are visiting London for the first time and want 
plan what they are going to do during their stay in the city. 

The main aim for me was to create an app that had an intuitive user interface and created a sense of community amongst its users. 

This project was my third Milestone Project as part of the Diploma in Software Development at Code Institute.

## **User Experience**

## User Stories 

Before I began the design proccess for my project I created the following user stories. This really helped me understand more 
about the kind of users the website may attract and how I could go about desinging an interface that would satisfy their needs. 

### **Project Stakeholders** 

* Being the creator of the Exlpore London app I am the main project stakeholder so it was in my best interest to provide 
a platform that staisfied all potential users needs through an intuitive user interface that is easy on the eye and simple to navigate 
which in turn should encourage users to return to use the app again. 

### New users 

* I am user who is going to being visiting London for the first time. I want to use an app which will enable me to 
plan my entire trip. I am wanting to find the best place for me stay, places to eat and drink and things to do during my visit.

* I am a user who currently lives central London. Me and my partner have been drinking in the same pub for years and have decided 
we want to start exploring some of the other pubs in London. I want to find an app where I can find recommendations for the best pubs to go to. 

* I am a user who lives in London. I have two children and the summer holidays are approaching so I am wanting to find an app that 
will help me find some new and exciting things for us to do. 

### Returning Users 

* I am a user who has the been using the app over the last few months. I recently ate out at an amazing resteraunt in Shoreditch
so i have returned to add it to the app as a new recommendation. 

* I am a user who visits London every summer. Last year I planned my trip using the app which was fantastic so I have returned 
again this year to plan my upcoming trip. 

* I am a user who regularly travels to London on business. I always use the app to keep up to date with the best places to stay
in London whilst I am on my business trips. 

### Mobile user 

* I am a user who wants to use the app on my mobile device. I want it to be intuitive to use as well as the information being presented 
in a clear and organised fashion.
