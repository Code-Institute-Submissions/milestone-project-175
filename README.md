## **What is the purpose of this project?**
Explore London is an app that aims to provide a platform where users are able to discover the best places to stay, eat and
drink as well as the best things to do in the capitol. The app will enable users to register and create their own account where 
they will be able to add their own recommendations to the website as well as edit and delete them if they wish to do so. 

The app is aimed at a wide range of users, from locals who live in the city, to tourists who are visiting London for the first time and want 
plan what they are going to do during their stay in the city. 

The main aim for me was to create an app that had an intuitive user interface and created a sense of community amongst its users. 

This project was my third Milestone Project as part of the Diploma in Software Development at Code Institute.
